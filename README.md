Scripts that automate the installation of VapourSynth and a bunch of ESRGAN/MXnet super resolution stuff. Because it's a pain to install by hand, and you can upscale with a GUI!

ONLY supports Windows. Works best with Nvidia GPUs.

**Scripts under construction!** Some of the project works, but the CUDA installer needs testing, and FFMPEG, batch scripts with useful presets, and some other things are still missing!
