A set of scripts that automate the process of installing Vapoursynth, MXNet, various python modules and pre-trained image upscalers in a portable folder, as well as CUDA 10 and cuDNN in the default install locations. Also includes Vapoursynth and Python scripts that can batch process all images in a directory, and handle alpha channels, as well as some pre-configured VapourSynth video processing scripts. 

I'm away from my desktop for a few months, so commits will be limited, but this project is still active!

Scripts under construction, read the WIP README at your own peril!
