Scripts that automate the installation of VapourSynth and a bunch of ESRGAN/MXnet super resolution stuff. Because it's a pain to install by hand, and you can upscale with a GUI!

ONLY supports Windows. Works best with Nvidia GPUs.

This is basically a simple installer for ChaosKing's portable vapoursynth fatpack, WolframRhodium's super resolution stuff, and a bunch of Python packages:

* https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo

But it also includes an image processing script that searches a directory for images, run them through vapoursynth functions, and write the processed images to a different folder with the same file structure. It also supports alpha layers, and heterogenous image collections.  

**Scripts under construction!** Some of the project works, but the CUDA installer needs testing, and FFMPEG, batch scripts with useful presets, and some other things are still missing!
